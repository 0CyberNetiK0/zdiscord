# zdiscord (v5)

A Discord bot that runs in FiveM for the purpose of whitelisting, moderation and utilties using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). The goal is for this this resource to be easy to setup and expand upon while giving your staff team an easy method of support and moderation of players in game without actually launching FiveM. This resource also heavily support [QBCore](https://github.com/qbcore-framework) in most of it's functionality but it's not required

## Setup

1. Get a bot application if you haven't already [Guide Here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)

2. **IMPORTANT: Enable BOTH intents** on the **bot** page of step 1 ([Picture example](https://github.com/zfbx/zdiscord/wiki/FAQ#intents)) *If you don't do this.. your bot will NOT work.

3. Add the bot to your server - To do this copy the following link and replace `YOUR-BOT-ID` with your bots ID then follow the invite process to your discord from the link
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR-BOT-ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

4. Copy the resource into your fiveM resources directory and make sure it's named `zdiscord` (no -main or anything)

5. Make sure you have the [cfx-server-data](https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data) resource in your resources (at the very least you need `[system]/[builders]/yarn/`)

2. Add `ensure zdiscord` (or whatever you renamed it to) to your server's .cfg

3. Adjust the `config.js` variables to how you'd like them. (Optionally use [Convars](./docs/convars.md))

4. **If you missed step 2, go back and do it.. or else IT WONT WORK!**
