## About

A Discord bot that runs in FiveM for the purpose of whitelisting, moderation and utilties using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). The goal is for this this resource to be easy to setup and expand upon while giving your staff team an easy method of support and moderation of players in game without actually launching FiveM. This resource also heavily support [QBCore](https://github.com/qbcore-framework) in most of it's functionality but it's not required



## Features

- Standalone FiveM resource (no external hosting required)
- Uses [Slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) with help/suggestions
- Moderation tools (kick, ban, inspect, etc)
- [QBCore](https://github.com/qbcore-framework) [commands](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/commands) included!
- Easy to expand and customize with modular [commands](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/commands#add-commands)!
- Can be configured with [convars](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/convars)
- Automatic Ace Permission granting system
- [Helpful exports](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/exports)

## Setup

### Requirements
- FiveM artifacts build 4800 or higher
- [cfx-server-data](https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data) in your resources (yarn (`[system]/[builders]/yarn/`) at least)
- Optional: [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic) if you want the /screenshot command to work

### Steps
1. Get a bot application if you haven't already [Guide Here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)

2. **IMPORTANT: Enable BOTH intents** on the **bot** page of step 1 ([Picture example](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/images/intents.png)) *If you don't do this.. your bot will NOT work.

3. Add the bot to your server - To do this copy the following link and replace `YOUR-BOT-ID` with your bots ID then follow the invite process to your discord from the link
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR-BOT-ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands`<br>
**NOTE: If the bot is already in your server you might need to run the link above again anyways to make sure it can get the needed slash command scope (unrelated to permissions)**

4. Copy the resource into your fiveM resources directory and make sure it's named `zdiscord` (no -main or anything)

5. Double check that you have the [cfx-server-data](https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data) resource in your resources (or yarn `[system]/[builders]/yarn/` at the very least)

6. In your `server.cfg` do the following:<br>
    6a. Add `ensure zdiscord` (after qb-core and/or [convars](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/convars) you may have)<br>
    6b. Add `add_ace resource.zdiscord command allow` anywhere in the .cfg file

7. Adjust the `config.js` variables to how you'd like them. (Optionally use [Convars](https://zfbx.github.io/zdiscord/convars))

8. **If you missed step 2, go back and do it.. or else IT WONT WORK!**
